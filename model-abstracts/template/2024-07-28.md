## Summary of Results
FILL

## General Model Description
FILL

## Explanation of observed dynamics given model assumptions 
FILL

## Model Calibration

### General calibration approach
FILL

### Was the model calibrated to 2023-24 data, and if so how? And how was the counterfactual scenario generated?
FILL

## Model Assumptions

### **Immunity assumptions** (describe protection against infection and severe disease, duration of immunity and waning distributions)

#### Immunity after natural infection
FILL

#### Maternal immunity
FILL

#### Immunity from maternal vaccines
FILL

#### Immunity from nirsevimab
FILL

#### Immunity from senior vaccines
FILL

### **Seasonality implementation**
FILL

### **Initial Conditions**
FILL

### **Age groups considered** (especially within under 1 yo, and whether within season aging is considered)
FILL

### **Geography**

#### State-stratification details (prior immunity, seasonality, severity/reporting)
FILL

#### Process to generate national projections (separate model fitted to US data vs aggregation of projection from RSVnet states)
FILL

### **Other Model Assumptions**
