## Round 1: Impact of new interventions - Mid-season projections for the 2023-24 season

The primary goal of SMH RSV Round 1 is to build capacity within the hub to model 
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) dynamics in the US and assess the feasibility 
of modeling this pathogen at the scale of the US given limited availability of 
epidemiological data. A secondary goal is to use nascent RSV modeling 
capabilities to generate ensemble projections for the impact of new 
interventions that are coming online during the 2023-24 season. We will 
consider 5 scenarios in total, following a 2\*2 table describing the impact 
of long-acting monoclonals targeted at infants (first dimension, optimistic 
and pessimistic protection) and senior vaccination (second dimension, 
optimistic and pessimistic protection). A 5th counterfactual scenario will 
consider status quo RSV mitigation. Projections will be generated for a 
29-week period, running Sun Nov 12, 2023 to Sat June 1, 2024. The scenario 
structure is as follows:

### Assumptions regarding RSV interventions

Weekly cumulative age-specific coverage for vaccines and monoclonals are 
[provided](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/auxiliary-data/archive/vaccine_coverage/RSV_round1_Coverage_2023_2024.csv).

We describe important details of the planned implementation of RSV 
interventions below as well as our rationale for vaccine coverage and 
effectiveness assumptions.

#### Implementation of RSV Interventions

##### Infants

Long-acting monoclonal antibodies (nirsevimab) were 
[recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7234a4.htm)
for prophylactic use in infants on August 3, 2023, and an 
[update](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00499.asp#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20limited,risk%20for%20severe%20RSV%20disease) 
due to limited availability in the 2023-24 season  was issued on 
October 23, 2023. Current recommendations are that all infants aged <6 months 
who are born during or entering their first RSV season should be prioritized to 
receive the new monoclonals. Older children up to 19 months who are at 
increased risk for severe RSV disease should not be prioritized for the new 
monoclonals. Older children at high risk will continue to receive the older 
monoclonals used in prior years. 
**We require that teams implement new monoclonal interventions in infants <6 months**, 
while explicit consideration of interventions in older high-risk babies (a 
small fraction of all US babies, see later) is at teams’ discretion. The new 
long-acting monoclonals will be administered in most of the continental United 
States from October through the end of March, the months of highest RSV 
activity. 

For infants < 6 months the process is as follows: 

- during the RSV season Oct 2023-Mar 2024, a fraction of all newborns will 
  receive long-acting monoclonals at birth (fraction based on weekly 
  monoclonal coverage)
- a fraction of infants who are born from Apr-Sep 2023 and are <6 months at 
  the start of the season will receive a catch up dose of monoclonals during 
  the RSV season, Oct 2023-Mar 2024 (also based on weekly coverage). No 
  infant >= 6 months can receive monoclonals.

##### Seniors

Senior RSV vaccination was 
[recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7229a4.htm) in July 2023 
for individuals over 60 yrs. We recommend that teams consider vaccination in 
all individuals 60+ yrs, even though the hospitalisation target data is only 
available for individuals 65+ yrs. However the exact implementation of 
targeting 60+ yrs is left at teams’ discretion. Vaccination will proceed 
seasonally, similarly to the flu vaccine, between Sep 2023 (slightly slower 
start than flu vaccine) and June 2024. Because RSV is not a well known pathogen 
among seniors, and recommendations stipulate that vaccination should occur 
after consultation with a physician (unlike flu), we assume that the 
intervention will have limited uptake.

##### Coverage assumptions

We will index the coverage of RSV interventions on flu vaccine coverage in a 
given state and relevant age group to reflect different propensities of 
different states to adopt new health interventions. The roll out of RSV 
interventions is likely to be slow since it is the first year interventions 
have been approved, and there are shortages and fee reimbursement issues for 
infant interventions. 

CDC flu vaccine curves from 2021-22 will be used to estimate anticipated 
coverage of RSV interventions (similarly to recent flu and COVID-19 rounds). 
Specifically, for infants, weekly interpolated flu coverage will be shifted by 
2 months (monoclonals will start on Oct 1, 2023) and administration will end at 
the end of March 2024 to reflect i) a late start of RSV interventions in the 
2023-24 season and ii) CDC recommendations. For seniors, we will use the actual 
timing of flu vaccination shifted by only one month since the RSV vaccine was 
recommended in the summer. For both infants and seniors, weekly flu vaccine 
estimates will be adjusted for the intended level of RSV coverage saturation. 
We generally expect real coverage in 2023-24 to track with our pessimistic 
coverage assumptions, while we have chosen optimistic levels of coverage that 
would reflect potential benefits in a future season with no shortage and more 
awareness of these interventions. 
**Senior and infant vaccination coverage curves are provided for all projection weeks and target locations**,
in the [Github vaccine coverage auxiliary data folder](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/auxiliary-data/archive/vaccine_coverage/)

##### VE Assumptions

We stipulate VE against hospitalizations for both senior vaccination and infant 
monoclonals, since severe RSV disease is the primary endpoint of most clinical 
trials (generally lower respiratory tract infection or RSV-associated 
hospitalizations, see literature below). 
Scenario assumption values are based on optimistic and pessimistic 
interpretation of the randomized control trial data. For seniors, VE values 
considered are **70%** (scenarios B, D) and **90%** (scenarios A, C).  
For infants, VE values considered are **60%** (scenarios C, D) and 
**80%** (scenarios A, B). 

RCTs – senior vaccines:  
- GSK, [Papi et al](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2209604)
- Pfizer, [Walsh et al](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2213836)
    
RCTs in infants - Nirsevimab:
- Full term infants, [Hammitt et al](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110275)
- Pre-term infants, [Griffin et al](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1913556)

It is at teams’ discretion to proportionate VE values into protection against 
infection, protection against severe disease given infection, and any effect on 
transmission. However note that the current thinking and available data 
suggests a very limited protection against infection, 
[Wilkins et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02316-5), 
if any. There is no data on transmission and the possible impact on these 
interventions on RSV shedding, so a small to moderate transmission effect 
cannot be ruled out.

##### Assumptions about duration of protection

We do not prescribe a specific duration of protection for senior vaccination or 
infant monoclonals. Teams can refer to existing literature cited in the above 
section. As a general guideline, monoclonals are expected to provide protection 
for a mean of 6 months, while senior protection remains relatively stable 
within 2 years of vaccination.

##### Other RSV-specific interventions

None of the scenarios consider maternal vaccination (to protect infants after 
birth) since maternal interventions are not expected to have high enough 
coverage to make a significant impact on the 2023-24 season at the time of 
scenario specification. Teams should not model maternal vaccines. Consideration 
of non-specific RSV interventions such as a low level of residual masking is 
allowed.

##### Counterfactual scenario (scenario E)

In this scenario, we consider no change to the historic policy of RSV 
mitigation, which consists in a limited coverage of palivizumab monoclonals 
to high-risk premature infants (~2% of the US birth cohort receives a partial or 
full dose,
[Ambrose et al](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/hv.32082)). 
The calibration data available from 2017-present takes into account the impact 
of this intervention. Teams have discretion to consider this policy explicitly 
or ignore it given the small fraction of infants covered. We note that high 
risk premature infants <6mo who previously would have received palivizumab 
(the older treatment) will now receive the new monoclonal nirsevimab, with 
comparable effectiveness. Due to shortages in 2023-24, older high risk babies
will keep receiving palivizumab this season.

### Handling intrinsic transmissibility and severity in the calibration process

It is important that all scenario simulations share the same values (or ranges of 
values) for intrinsic transmissibility and severity of RSV infection at the start of 
projections (that is, severity and transmissibility in the absence of interventions, 
where severity is risk of hospitalization given infection). To do so, teams should 
ensure that the calibration step uses similar transmissibility and severity 
parameters across scenarios. Only by using assumptions that lead to starting 
conditions for transmissibility and severity that effectively come from a shared 
distribution across scenarios, we can evaluate the impact of different interventions 
in the projection period. 

We suggest that teams use one of the 3 following options for calibration (i) choose 
one of the 5 proposed scenarios for calibration (ideally, the scenario that seems the 
most plausible given what is known about interventions until the cut-off date on 
Nov-11), or (ii) use real-world coverage in infants and seniors that has been 
reported until the cut-off date in the calibration step. Once transmissibility and 
severity have been estimated, go back to the start of interventions prescribed in 
scenarios A-E (ie, early Oct) and apply assumed level of interventions in each 
scenario until Nov 11 and throughout the projection period. iii) use a shared 
distribution of parameters that is consistent with all scenarios.

### RSV Model Calibration

#### RSV-NET Dataset

Age- and state-specific data on laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalization rates 
are available for 12 states and the US from RSV-NET spanning 2017-18 to present 
([RSV-NET CDC Webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/rsv-net/index.html)). 
RSV-NET is an RSV hospitalization surveillance network that collects data on 
laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations through a network of 
acute care hospitals in a subset of states (12 states as of August 2023). 
Age-specific weekly rates per 100,000 population are reported in this system. 

The data has been standardized and posted on the 
[SMH RSV github target-data/ folder](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/target-data/) and is updated weekly. 
**The target in this data is the weekly number of hospitalizations in each given state (inc_hosp variable), for all ages and by age group**. 
To obtain counts, we have converted RSV-NET weekly rates based on state 
population sizes. This method assumes that RSV-NET hospitals are representative 
of the whole state. To obtain national US counts, we have used the rates 
provided for the “overall RSV-NET network”. The data covers 2017-present. 
Reported age groups include: [0-6 months[, [6-12 months[, [1-2 yr[, [2-4 yr[, 
[5-17 yr[, [18-49 yr[, [50-64 yr[, and 65+ years.  The standardized dataset 
provided by SMH includes week- state- and age-specific RSV counts (the target), 
rates, and population sizes. 
**Note that different states joined RSVnet in different years (between 2014 and 2018) while RSV surveillance throughout the network was initially limited to adults. Children RSV surveillance began in the 2018-19 season.**

The source of age distribution used for calibration (RSV-NET vs other 
estimates) should be provided in the abstract metadata that is submitted with 
the projections.

#### Other RSV datasets available for calibration

A few auxiliary datasets have been posted in the GitHub repositority 
[auxiliary-data/ folder](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/auxiliary-data/) 
 including: 

- state-specific CDC surveillance from NVERSS (only last year of data available)
- state-specific ED data (only last year of data available)

### Targets

In this round, we will 
**require submission of 100 individual trajectories for each target** while 
**submission of quantiles is optional**. Targets will be based on the RSV-NET 
dataset. The required targets for trajectories 
**will be weekly RSV incident hospital admissions (counts) in the 12 RSV-NET states, nationally for all ages, and for a set of minimal age groups; a more resolved set of age groups is strongly encouraged (see below)**. 
Estimates of cumulative counts can be obtained from weekly trajectories and 
hence we do not require trajectories for cumulative counts. Similarly, peak 
targets (peak hospital admission magnitude and peak timing) can be 
reconstructed from weekly trajectories. Teams who wish to submit quantiles 
along with trajectories should provide quantiles for weekly and cumulative 
counts, as well as for hospital admission peak size and peak timing. 

#### Weekly targets

- Weekly *reported* all-age and age-specific state-level incident hospital 
  admissions, based on RSV-NET. This dataset is updated daily and covers 
  2017-2023. There should be no adjustment for reporting (=raw data from 
  RSV-NET dataset to be projected). A current and standardized version of 
  the weekly data has been posted [here](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/target-data/)
- No infection target
- No case target
- No death target
- All targets should be numbers of individuals, rather than rates

#### Age target

##### Required

- Hospital admissions should be provided for the following age groups: 
  all ages,  <1 yr, 1-4, 5-64, and 65+. (Most of the RSV burden on 
  hospitalizations comes from the 0-1 and 65+ age groups)

##### Additional age details (optional)

- Weekly state-specific and national RSV hospitalizations among individuals 
  <1 yr, 1-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65+, and all ages

#### Optional targets (if submitting quantiles in addition to trajectories)

- Cumulative hospital admissions. Cumulative outcomes start at 0 at the start 
  of projections, on Nov 12, 2023
- State-level peak hospital admissions
- State-level timing of peak hospital admission

### Timeline

- **Scenarios set (no changes after)**: *Friday, Oct 27, 2023*
- **Projections due**: *Tuesday, Nov 14, 2023*
- **Report finalized**: *No later than November 24, 2023*

### Other specifications and assumptions

#### Overall RSV dynamics and severity

Several reference studies are worth considering to set (or guide) RSV model 
parameters that cannot be estimated from the available hospitalization data. 
These include work by Ginny Pitzer and colleagues in the US (see 
[Pitzer et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25569275/) for state-specific 
models driven by environmental drivers in the pre-intervention era, including 
Table 2 for parameters; and 
[Zheng et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36302926/) for an 
updated model with interventions).  
Risk of severity given infection was parametrized in these models based on 
children cohort studies in the US and Kenya: see 
[Nokes et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15499540/), 
[Glezen et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3706232/), and 
[Breese Hall at al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19196675/). 

Since these studies have been published, there has been an increased 
recognition of the burden of RSV among seniors (see 
[Jackson et al](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/1/147/585958), 
[Rha et al](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/146/1/e20193611/37046/Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-Associated), 
and 
[McLaughlin et al](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/9/7/ofac300/6609557?login=false)

#### Prior Immunity

- Prior immunity is at each team’s discretion. Immunity against infection is 
  waning rapidly for RSV; based on prior modeling work, estimates of duration of 
  immunity against infection range between 200-365 days. However, immunity 
  against severe disease can be more long-lasting and generally increases with 
  age and  number of prior infections (eg see discussion in 
  [Pitzer et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25569275/)). Overall, most 
  individuals will get reinfected multiple times throughout life, but severe RSV 
  infections that lead to hospitalizations tend to only occur among young 
  children and seniors. Maternal immunity is expected to be brief
- Teams are allowed to vary prior immunity by age or other demographic 
  characteristic, and state
- Unlike influenza virus, antigenic evolution is not a key feature of RSV

#### COVID-19 Interactions

- No major interactions with future COVID-19 and flu surges (e.g., 
  immunological, social, behavioural) should be considered in this round 
- We note that many studies have reported that RSV circulation was perturbed 
  during the COVID19 pandemic, as can be seen in the RSVnet data. Whether and 
  how to fit the COVID19 pandemic period is left at teams discretion

#### Projection Period

- Sun Nov 12, 2023 to Sat June 1, 2024 (29 weeks)

#### State-level variability

- Variability in severity and **reporting to RSV-NET** between states is 
  possible
  
#### Seasonality

Teams should include their best estimates of RSV seasonality in their model but 
we do not prescribe a specific level of seasonal forcing.

#### NPI

No reactive NPIs to COVID-19 or influenza should be modeled in this round; 
low level masking is allowed at groups’ discretion.

#### Seeding of RSV

We leave seeding intensity, timing and geographic distribution at the 
discretion of the teams. In addition to the RSV-NET hospital admission 
dataset, CDC’s NVERSS 
[viral surveillance dataset](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub/tree/main/auxiliary-data) 
is a good resource for state-specific information on epidemic intensity 
(e.g., weekly % positive, or weekly ILI*%positive), and can be used to adjust 
seeding.

#### Initial Conditions

Prior immunity and amount of infections at the start of the projection period 
is at the discretion of the teams based on their interpretation of the 
scenarios. Variation in initial prevalence between states is left at teams’ 
discretion. 

**All of the teams’ specific assumptions should be documented in meta-data and abstract.**

#### Other submission requirements

- Simulation trajectories: We ask that teams submit a sample of 100 simulation 
  replicates. Simulations should be sampled in such a way that they will be most 
  likely to produce the uncertainty of the simulated process. For some 
  models, this may mean a random sample of simulations, for others with 
  larger numbers of simulations, it may require weighted sampling. Trajectories 
  will need to be paired across age groups (eg, for a given model, location, 
  scenario and week, all age data for simulation 1 corresponds to the sum of
  age-specific estimates for simulation 1).
- Geographic scope: state-level and national projections
  - 12 states or a subset of 12 states, US overall recommended.

- Results: 
  - Summary: Results must consist of a subset of weekly targets listed
    below; all are not required. 
  - Weeks follow epi-weeks (Sun-Sat) dated by the last day of the week. 
  - **Weekly Targets**: Weekly incident hospitalizations by location, 
    all ages and age-specific

- Metadata: We will require a brief meta-data form, from all teams.

- Uncertainty: 
  - For trajectories (required submission): we require 100 trajectories.
  - For quantiles (optional submission) We ask for 0.01, 0.025, 0.05,
    every 5% to 0.95, 0.975, and 0.99. Teams are also encouraged to submit 
    0 (min value) and 1 (max) quantiles if possible.
