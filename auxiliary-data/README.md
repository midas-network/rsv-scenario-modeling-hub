# Auxiliary Data

This folder is used to store additional data relevant to the RSV modeling efforts. 
It contains multiple folders: 

  - one for vaccine coverage ([vaccine_coverage/](./vaccine_coverage/))
  - one for RSV data from different CDC sources, including the python code to 
  extract and update the data ([rsv/](./rsv/))
  - one for target-data archive ([target-data/](./target-data))
  - one for location and population data ([location_census/](./location_census/))
  - one for birth rate data ([birth_rate/](./birth_rate/))
  - past round specification information ([rounds/](./rounds/))
  - one for reports ([reports/](./reports/))
  - one for model examples ([model_examples](./model_examples))
  - one archive for past version and past round associated auxiliary data files
  ([archive/](./archive/))

  
## Vaccine Coverage

The folder [vaccine_coverage/](./vaccine_coverage/) provides weekly 
state-specific cumulative coverage for specific rounds.

### Round 2 - 2024 / 2025

#### Senior

For round 2, the file 
[vaccine_coverage/RSV_round2_vax_coverage_seniors_2024_25.csv](./vaccine_coverage/RSV_round2_vax_coverage_seniors_2024_25.csv) 
provides weekly vaccine coverage (cumulative percentage, cumulative no of doses, 
size of eligible population) for seniors from summer 2024 to the end of the 
projection period for RSVnet states. Separate values are provided for seniors 
60-74 high risk and 75+.

Coverage should be considered additive to that of last season. The same coverage 
values apply to all intervention scenarios (A-D), while the counterfactual (F) 
assumes no coverage.

#### Maternal & Infant

- [RSV_RD2_maternal_vaccine_2024_25.csv](./vaccine_coverage/RSV_RD2_maternal_vaccine_2024_25.csv) 
has weekly state-specific coverage for maternal vaccine. The weekdate is the 
Saturday at the end of each week. This date represents the date when the mother 
was vaccinated, so that the vaccine effect on the infant would start on average 
one month later after the baby is born. Columns are provided for total state pop 
size (`Total_pop`), annual number of births (`Births_per_year`), Scenarios 
(`"A"` through `"D"`), No of weekly vaccine doses administered 
(`Maternal_vaccine_weekly_doses`), No of eligible mothers throughout the 
season (`Eligible_mothers_entire_season`, calculated as the no of moms who 
are eligible for vaccination at **any time point of the campaign**), weekly 
incident coverage (`Weekly_incident_cov`, calculated as weekly doses 
divided by the number of eligible mothers), and cumulative coverage 
(calculated as the cumulative sum of weekly incidence coverage)
- [RSV_RD2_nirsevimab_aggregated_2024_25.csv](./vaccine_coverage/RSV_RD2_nirsevimab_aggregated_2024_25.csv) 
has a similar structure as the maternal vaccine file for nirsevimab. 
Note that the column `Dose_Type` indicates whether a baby is vaccinated at 
birth (at a constant rate throughout the season; New Born) or during the 
catch-up campaign (accelerated immunization in the first month of the season; 
Catch Up). `Eligible_babies_entire_season` reflects the number of babies in each 
category (catchup/newborn) who are **eligible for nirsevimab at any time point during 
the campaign.** Weekly incident and cumulative coverages are estimated based on 
this eligible population
- [RSV_RD2_nirsevimab_byweekofage_2024_25.csv](./vaccine_coverage/RSV_RD2_nirsevimab_byweekofage_2024_25.csv) 
is a version of the above file where the catch-up babies have been disaggregated 
by single week of age. This is the age at **receipt** of nirsevimab. Eligible babies 
counts the number of babies would are of that age in any given week of the season, 
which represents one week of babies.

In all files, the first and last weeks of the campaign have lower vaccination rates 
than other weeks to account for the fact that the campaign starts and ends at precise 
dates which do not exactly match with the start of a week  (eg Aug 15, Sep 1... etc).

**For teams that require US-level vaccine coverage, we advise to either do a 
weighted mean of the state coverage proportions, where the weights are the state 
population sizes. Or you can also sum all the state-level no of doses and 
state-level populations**
  

## Reports

The [reports](./reports/) folder contains reports from previous Scenario 
Modeling Hub rounds. At the time they were produced, some of these reports were 
intended to be shared only with certain stakeholders and have disclaimers to 
that effect. All reports have since become publicly available.

Each report contains an executive summary with key messages and results, 
and analyses of ensemble and individual projections. Results at national and 
state level are available for all targets.

  
## Location and Census Data

The folder [location_census/](./location_census/) contains two files:

- [location_census/locations.csv](./location_census/locations.csv) containing
  the state and national full name, 2 letter abbreviation and fips code as used 
  in the hub. The file also contains the population size
- [location_census/state_pop_data](./location_census/state_pop_data.csv) 
  contains the population size per year, state (and national level), age from
  2010 to 2022 (included). The data are coming from the US Census Bureau:
  - Annual Estimates of the Civilian Population by Single Year of Age and Sex 
  for the United States and States: April 1, 2010 to July 1,

## Birth Rate

The folder [birth_rate/](./birth_rate/) contains multiple files:

- [natality_](./birth_rate/) files containing total number of births per 
  state and per year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
  National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System, 
  Natality on CDC WONDER Online Database
- [birth_rate_2016_2022.txt](./birth_rate/birth_rate_2016_2022.txt) containing
  the birth rate per state and year from the Centers for Disease Control and 
  Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics 
  System, Natality on CDC WONDER Online Database
- [birth_rate_1995_2022.txt](./birth_rate/birth_rate_2016_2022.txt) containing
   the calculated birth rate and standardized birth rate from the "natality_" 
   and other "birth_rate" files from 1995 to 2022 per year and per state.

## Target Data

The [target-data](./target-data) folder contains archive of the target-data
data with additional information (hospitalization rate, population size). 
The data are automatically updated on Monday, with the date append to the 
file name.
  
## RSV data

The folder [rsv/](./rsv/) contains the RSV data divided in three sub-folders: 
one per each CDC source and the python code to extract and update the data.

The data is updated weekly by the 
[update-rsv-data](../.github/workflows/update-rsv-data.yaml) GitHub Action, 
which runs weekly on Friday morning, 9:00 am UTC.

Age Group and Jurisdiction assessed through the Immunization Information System (IIS) obtained from 
[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Monthly-Cumulative-Number-and-Percent-of-Children-/ku7p-zn4c/about_data). Note that the IIS underestimates the true coverage. The file also contains monthly national estimates of eceipt for nirsevimab reported by adult females 
ged 18–49 years with infants under the age of 8 months obtained from the 
[National Immunization Survey-Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM)](https://www.cdc.gov/rsvvaxview/dashboard/2023-24-nirsevimab-coverage-infants.html).

The NIS and IIS estimates are based on different groups of children recommended to receive nirsevimab. 
The IIS estimates include only "catch-up: babies" ie excludes babies who would become eligible on or 
after October 1, 2023 (i.e., babies born October 2023 - March 2024 are excluded). Further, IIS is 
based on an administrative database which may miss  a fraction of immunizations.
