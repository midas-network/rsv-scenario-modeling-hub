# Scenario Modeling Hub Round Report

This folder contains reports from previous Scenario Modeling Hub rounds. 
At the time they were produced, some of these reports were intended to be 
shared only with certain stakeholders and have disclaimers to that effect. 
All reports have since become publicly available.

Each report contains an executive summary with key messages and results, 
and analyses of ensemble and individual projections. Results at national and 
state level are available for all targets.
