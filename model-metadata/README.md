# Model Metadata

This folder contains metadata files for each team-models submitting to the 
RSV Scenario Modeling Hub. 

Each model is required to have metadata in yaml format and should contains
required information and be stored in a team-model specific sub-directory.

Examples files are available in the 
[auxiliary-data/model_examples](../auxiliary-data/model_examples) folder

----

## Subdirectory

Each sub-directory within the [model-metadata/](./) directory has the
format:

    team-model
    
where 

- `team` is the abbraviated teamname (`team_abbr`) and 
- `model` is the abbreviated name of your model (`model_abbr`). 

Both team and model should be less than 15 characters, and not include
hyphens nor spaces.

The `team-model` should correspond to the `team-model` sub-directory in the
associated model-output folder containing the associated projections.
