methods: "Age-structured ordinary differential equations model"
methods_long: "The model framework is based on ordinary differential equations and age-stratified contact matrices derived from both macro (census) and micro (survey) data sources. RSV transmissibility follows a seonal pattern which is calibrated using  hospitalization data from RSV-Net for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 seasons. Furthermore, our model uses age-dependent infection-to-hospitalization risks, whose posterior distribution is estimated by our optimization procedure and their prior distribution is based on RSV literature."
