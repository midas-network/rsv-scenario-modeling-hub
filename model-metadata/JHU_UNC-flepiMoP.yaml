methods: "Compartmental model of RSV transmission and disease dynamics using flepiMoP framework"
methods_long: "flepiMoP is a comprehensive open-source software pipeline for creating and simulating compartmental models of infectious disease transmission and inferring parameters through these models. We implement an SIR model stratified by age, level of prior infection and level of immunity from maternally acquired antibodies. Seasonality is introduced using a sinusoidal seasonal forcing."

team_funding: "The development of this model was supported by from funds from Council of the National Science Foundation (2127976; ST, AH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (200-2016-91781; ST, AH, JL, JCL, SL, S-m.J), US Department of Health and Human Services / Department of Homeland Security (ST, CPS, JK, ECL, AH, JL), California Department of Public Health (ST, JL), Johns Hopkins University (ST, JL), Amazon Web Services (ST, AH, JL, JCL), National Institutes of Health (R01GM140564; JL, 5R01AI102939; JCL)."
