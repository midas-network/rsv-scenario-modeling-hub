methods: "Hybrid data-driven and mechanistic model"
methods_long: "We first applied a data-driven method (long-short term memory) to track the hospitalization trajectory, and perform model fitting and calibration based on historical data. The baseline scenario is developed. Then a mechanistic model is applied on the baseline scenario to further simulate various scenarios."
